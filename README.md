# node-and-express.js
Apps made with express.js

This is a CRUD application made with node and express.js where I have created a basic REST API.
I have created:
-GET requests
-PUT requests
-POST requests
-DELETE requests

After that I have adapted the application to be used with "Handlebars" for rendering server side templates.
